 * 🔍 CRITICAL PAYMENT FLOW ANALYSIS

 */

console.log('🔍 ANALYZING PAYMENT FLOW...')

// Step 1: Registration creates SetupIntent
console.log('\n📝 STEP 1: Registration Flow')
console.log('✅ User registers → Database subscription created with status: PENDING_PAYMENT')
console.log('✅ SetupIntent created in Stripe (for payment method collection)')
console.log('✅ User redirected to payment page with SetupIntent client_secret')

// Step 2: Payment page
console.log('\n💳 STEP 2: Payment Page')
console.log('✅ User enters card details')
console.log('✅ stripe.confirmSetup() called')
console.log('✅ If successful: Stripe redirects to success page with setup_intent parameter')

// Step 3: Success page
console.log('\n🎉 STEP 3: Success Page')
console.log('✅ Success page calls /api/confirm-payment with setupIntentId')
console.log('✅ handleSetupIntentConfirmation() is called')

// Step 4: Critical analysis of handleSetupIntentConfirmation
console.log('\n🚨 STEP 4: CRITICAL ANALYSIS - handleSetupIntentConfirmation()')
console.log('Line 8-11: ✅ Retrieves SetupIntent and checks if status === "succeeded"')
console.log('Line 12: ✅ Gets payment method ID from successful SetupIntent')
console.log('Line 26: ✅ Updates Stripe customer with default payment method')
console.log('Line 28-31: 🔍 Creates invoice items and invoice for prorated amount (IF > 0)')
console.log('Line 37-44: ✅ Creates Stripe subscription with trial_end')
console.log('Line 46: 🚨 ALWAYS marks database subscription as ACTIVE')
console.log('Line 50: 🚨 ALWAYS creates payment record as CONFIRMED (if proratedAmount > 0)')

// Step 5: The critical issue
console.log('\n🚨 THE CRITICAL ISSUE:')
console.log('❌ SetupIntent "succeeded" only means PAYMENT METHOD was saved')
console.log('❌ It does NOT mean any payment was actually charged')
console.log('❌ Stripe subscription is created with trial_end (future date)')
console.log('❌ No immediate payment is collected')
console.log('❌ But database is marked as ACTIVE and payment as CONFIRMED')

// Step 6: What should happen
console.log('\n✅ WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:')
console.log('1. SetupIntent succeeds → Payment method saved')
console.log('2. If prorated amount > 0 → Invoice should be PAID immediately')
console.log('3. Webhook should confirm invoice.payment_succeeded')
console.log('4. Only THEN mark subscription as ACTIVE')

// Step 7: Current vs Expected Stripe status
console.log('\n📊 CURRENT STATE:')
console.log('Stripe Subscription Status: INCOMPLETE (no payment collected)')
console.log('Database Status: ACTIVE (incorrectly marked)')
console.log('Payment Record: CONFIRMED (fake record)')
console.log('User Access: FULL ACCESS (getting service for free)')

console.log('\n🎯 CONCLUSION:')
console.log('Users are getting FREE ACCESS because:')
console.log('1. SetupIntent succeeds (payment method saved)')
console.log('2. Database marked as ACTIVE immediately')
console.log('3. But no actual payment collected from Stripe')
console.log('4. Stripe subscription remains INCOMPLETE')
console.log('5. Webhooks fail because subscription is incomplete')

console.log('\n🔧 REQUIRED FIXES:')
console.log('1. Only mark as ACTIVE after payment is actually collected')
console.log('2. Wait for invoice.payment_succeeded webhook')
console.log('3. Handle incomplete subscriptions properly')
console.log('4. Sync database with actual Stripe status')
