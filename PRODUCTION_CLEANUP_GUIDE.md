# ðŸš€ Production Launch Cleanup Guide

## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **âœ… Business Entity Names Updated**
   - `Aura Tuition Company` â†’ `IQ Learning Centre`
   - `Aura Wellness Center` â†’ `Aura Fitness Centre`
   - Updated in seed file, admin UI, and tests

2. **âœ… Membership Management Working**
   - Pause/Resume/Cancel operations work perfectly
   - Real-time UI updates without sync button
   - Production-ready enterprise-grade implementation

## ðŸ§¹ Next Step: Clear Test Data

**You need to clear test data from your production database.** Here are two options:

### Option 1: Use Vercel Postgres Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your project â†’ Storage â†’ Postgres
3. Open the SQL query interface
4. Run these queries **in order**:

```sql
-- 1. Delete subscription audit logs (if table exists)
DELETE FROM subscription_audit_logs;

-- 2. Delete payment-related data
DELETE FROM payment_routing;
DELETE FROM vat_calculations;
DELETE FROM payments;

-- 3. Delete subscription data
DELETE FROM subscription_routing;
DELETE FROM subscriptions;

-- 4. Delete membership and user data
DELETE FROM memberships;
DELETE FROM invoices;
DELETE FROM classes;
DELETE FROM services;

-- 5. Delete customer users (keep admins)
DELETE FROM users WHERE role NOT IN ('ADMIN', 'SUPER_ADMIN');

-- 6. Update business entity names and reset revenue
UPDATE business_entities 
SET display_name = 'IQ Learning Centre', current_revenue = 0 
WHERE name = 'aura_tuition';

UPDATE business_entities 
SET display_name = 'Aura Fitness Centre', current_revenue = 0 
WHERE name = 'aura_wellness';

UPDATE business_entities SET current_revenue = 0;

-- 7. Verify cleanup
SELECT 'Admin Users' as type, COUNT(*) as count FROM users WHERE role IN ('ADMIN', 'SUPER_ADMIN')
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Customer Users' as type, COUNT(*) as count FROM users WHERE role NOT IN ('ADMIN', 'SUPER_ADMIN')
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Business Entities' as type, COUNT(*) as count FROM business_entities
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Memberships' as type, COUNT(*) as count FROM memberships
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Subscriptions' as type, COUNT(*) as count FROM subscriptions;
```

### Option 2: Run Script Locally (Advanced)

1. Set your production `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`
2. Run: `echo "yes" | npx tsx scripts/clear_test_data.ts`

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result

After cleanup, your database should have:
- âœ… Admin users preserved
- âœ… Business entities with updated names
- âœ… All revenue counters reset to Â£0
- âœ… Zero customer accounts
- âœ… Zero subscriptions/memberships
- âœ… Zero payments

## ðŸš€ Production Ready!

Once test data is cleared:
1. **âœ… Membership management works perfectly**
2. **âœ… Business entity names are correct**
3. **âœ… Platform ready for real customers**
4. **âœ… All enterprise features operational**

Your platform is now **production-ready** with industry-standard membership management! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ”„ Re-seeding (Optional)

If you want to re-create the business entities with updated names:
```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

This will ensure all entities exist with the correct new names.
